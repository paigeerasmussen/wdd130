        <p>Hello! My name is Paige Rasmussen and I am studying Software Development at BYU-Pathway Worldwide. I enjoy
            art and music, and I look forward to learning more about web design and development as I build new skills

        <p>Utah, known as the “Beehive State,” is located in the Mountain West and is famous 
            for its stunning natural landscapes, from the snow-capped Wasatch Mountains and 
            the vast Great Salt Lake to the red rock canyons and arches of its five national 
            parks. Utah blends cultural heritage with outdoor adventure, offering world-class 
            skiing, hiking, and breathtaking desert scenery.</p>
